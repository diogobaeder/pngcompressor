pngcompressor - a multi-threaded compressor for PNG and GIF files.

Right now it uses only pngnq to compress the files, but in the future it will be passed by pngcrush processing too.
If a compressed file is smaller than the original, the original is removed. Otherwise, we keep the original one.
All non-animated GIF files will be tried upon compression, and pass through the same constraints above; In a success scenario, their extension is changed to ".png".
